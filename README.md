# Walmart-Sales-Analysis


This project analysis I have was undertaken with a strategic focus on handling large datasets efficiently. By cleaning and working with a subset of 2000 entries, my approach was to enhance computational efficiency while preserving the essence of the complete dataset. The analysis delves into customer behavior, exploring demographics, product characteristics, and transaction specifics to tailor strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings.
